# Generated Files
If you looked at the `build/` directory that was generated at by building the SoC, you would notice there is a software subdirectory that contains various headers and dependencies generated by LiteX for the specific SoC. Of these, the most important for compiling code for the SoC is found at `build/software/include/generated`. 

Important linker information is found in `output_format.ld` and `regions.ld`. These would need to be included in the linker script of your application such that the correct memory locations are utilised. `variables.mak` stores useful macros for use in the makefile of your application.

Looking at `csr.h`, you find all the relevant csr registers and related functions to write to them. This greatly simplifies the development work of setting up peripherals.

# Building and running the Test Program - Demo Test
Navigate to `LoRaDongle/SOC/arty_test/firmware` and run `make`. This will binary file titled `demo.bin` to be loaded to the SoC. Hopefully everything built successfully with no errors. 

Then call `make run` to load the application code to the SoC. You should see the LiteX bios starting and then loading the application code onto the SoC. See below:

Once loaded you will be greeted with the pompt `Arty-SoC-Test>` in which you can run the two to three functions that have been implemented. See below


If however you did not get this, try pressing the cpu reset button on the development you are using to reboot the SoC.

# Adding your own program
From here you add further functionality to the program being used. Additional header files should be saved to `firmware/include` and concurrently the source files should be placed in `firmware/src`.
