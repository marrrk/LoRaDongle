# Introduction
LoRaDongle is a project that aims to merge the Open Source ISA Risc-V with the wireless modulation protocol LoRa. 

Currently, the first prototype is in development in which various different tools and systems are brought together to build the project. The prototype is executed on a custom PCB that is populated with a Low Power Lattice FPGA - the iCE40UP5k that houses a softcore SoC.  On the same board, a SX1261 LoRa transeiver is populated and configure to transmit at 868MHz.
